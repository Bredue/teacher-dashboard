[Google Sheet for teachers to stay organized](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c3omUpgOZevlw98OfDOaUYe6_s3Ahp0I8juL9p3itnE/copy).

Core Functionality:
1. Can map out curriculum and calculate how many days are being spent on each subject and or reviewing / testing.
2. Calendar design for each calendar year can be retained and used to visualize mapping made in the calculator.
3. PLC Meetings sheet to take notes with team members on tasks, agendas, etc.
4. Task List that auto sorts first entry by most upcoming date. No longer do teachers need to scroll through endless lists of tasks that have already been completed. Now your task list will sort older tasks straight to the bottom removing bloat and wasted time scrolling.
5. CFA Data allows teachers to add tested subjects and teachers that are invovled with said topic. An App Script is written, but needs to be set up with a trigger (How-To on this will be added later). With the trigger setup on edit, whenever teachers add students to the list and their score the App Script will compile class period averages, top and bottom 10% of students per teacher. All of this data to help teachers visualize how their classes are doing in an easy to follow format.
6. Class Structure template sheet to help teachers stay on the same page with their team on how they want to structure their classes and how much time they want to aim for on each agenda item.
7. Student behavior sheet helps keep teachers on the same page with how they are monitoring behaviors and how they are resolving them to create a consistent environment for correcting behavior.
